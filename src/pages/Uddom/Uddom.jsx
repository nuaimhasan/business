              RREL has partnered with Uddom, a smart phone based application,
              UDDOM, to mobilize the untapped potential of the rural unserved
              market/population. Though UDDOM is at its initial stage, it
              harnesses the ‘green entrepreneur’ or the ‘uddokta’ (Bengali for
              entrepreneur) by motivating and empowering them to create a
              community or pool of customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is an ecosystem that maximizes the entrepreneurial drive by
              delivering products and services to customers which improve the
              standard and quality of life for much of Bangladesh’s Population
              that lives in rural and remote areas, without direct access to
              energy, clean drinking water, finance and health care.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use and application of these products have a direct impact on
              the economic status of the user/consumer through capacity
              building, increased monetary savings, maintaining health, enabling
              education and potential to create a sustainable source of income.
              Collectively, the long-term benefits are undeniable.
